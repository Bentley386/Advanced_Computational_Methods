# Advanced Computational Methods
Code and reports for the projects done during the Advanced Computational Methods course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana.
Most of the code is written for specific problems and needs to be modified for general usage.

### List of Projects
1. Schrödinger Equation - Direct Time Evolution
2. Schrödinger Equation - Stationary Problem and Spectral Methods
3. Trotter-Suzuki decomposition - Symplectic Integration
4. Trotter-Suzuki decomposition - Quantum Many Body Systems
5. Molecular Dynamics
6. Classical Monte Carlo
7. Quantum Monte Carlo
8. Matrix Product Ansatz
9. Time Evolution Block Decimation
10. Density Functional Theory
